	Assume that you are given an ordered binary tree of integers using the TreeItem and Tree201 classes defined in the lectures.
	
	Write a recursive function that will construct a corresponding sorted list of the same integers 
	using the ListItem and List201 classes defined in the lectures.
	
	Provide a test code to demonstrate the proper usage of your function.
