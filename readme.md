# Final - Spring 2022

1.
    1. (20) Write the requested code in file **ie201 - Final - Q1.1.py**.
    2. (5) Discuss the time complexity function of the code in Question 1 in file **ie201 - Final - Q1.2.md**.

2. (25) Assume that you want to collect the production data (batch id, item code, production time, quality status, etc.) on a machine. Production data that is stored is never deleted afterwards. Hence, we can assume that the number of data points is continually increasing (at some point, the size of the collection may even be larger than the RAM capacity.) Although it is not very frequent, we may need to access past production data of a specific batch-id in situations such as root cause analysis of an out-of-spec production. More frequently, we need to access the production data on a specific time period to perform statistical analysis. Recommend **one** data structure to manage the collection of production data objects. Explain how your data structure supports the indicated usage pattern. Be very specific and analytical in your arguments. Do not try to explain or analyze other data structures. I will penalize long unnecessary explanations. Write your answer in file **ie201 - Final - Q2.md**. If you want to provide a drawing, commit the picture of your drawing using a picture file (pdf, png, jpg, etc.) with name **ie201 - Final - Q2.***.

3. (15) Construct a B-Tree of order 1 by inserting the following integers in the given order: 20, 7, 16, 10, 2, 9, 5, 18, 6. Draw state of the B-Tree after inserting each integer. Commit the picture of your answer using a picture file (pdf, png, jpg, etc.) with name **ie201 - Final - Q3.***.

4. (25) Explain the most significant object oriented information sharing design aspect in your term project by drawing the **related part** of the collaboration diagram. Pick the most significant **one** and explain how you implemeted it in your own problem; do not define it in a general manner. Unnecessary information will be penalized. Commit the picture of your answer using a picture file (pdf, png, jpg, etc.) with name **ie201 - Final - Q4.***.

5. (15) Write the requested code in file **ie201 - Final - Q5.py**.
