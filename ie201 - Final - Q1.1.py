	(20 points)
	
	Write a recursive function that will return the 
	minimum absolute difference between values of any two sibling nodes 
	on a given ordered binary tree. 
	Function should return -1 if there are no nodes with two children in the tree. 
	Use the TreeItem and Tree201 classes defined in the lectures to represent the ordered binary tree.

	Provide a test code to demonstrate the proper usage of your function.
